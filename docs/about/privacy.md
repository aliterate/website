## Privacy Policy

### In brief

* We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.
* We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.
* We use SSL to keep your data safe in transit.

### Measuring our visitors

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) or [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) if you wish.

### Emails

We may send you email notifications regarding submissions (our robot) or subscriptions (such as invoices) or which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications when a report is completed). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.

We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.
