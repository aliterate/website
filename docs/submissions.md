## Submissions

### Submission Guidelines
* Read all the guidelines. This isn't a trick. The robot will reject e-mail containing common errors.
* Works between 3,000 and 12,000 words that are unpublished in English.
* We publish literary genre fiction: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Westerns, Pulps, Thrillers, Horror, Romance, etc. We do not publish poetry, inspirational fiction, or young adult fiction. For the most part we aren't interested in publishing erotica and graphic sex or violence. At this time we are not accepting unsolicited artwork.
* We accept simultaneous submissions, but only one submission per author per reading period.
* Review is blind. Please do not include your name or identifying information in your submitted document.
* Submission is open to all writers, apart from residents of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
* Please e-mail the editor with questions. We'll post broadly applicable answers here.

### Publication and Payment Terms

* Our pay rate is $0.06 / word.
* At your option, your story may appear on our website following publication.

### How to Submit
* Our reading period is currently open. It closes on April 30, 2016.
* All submissions are by e-mail, sent to submissions@aliterate.org. You can either attach a single file or paste your story. Attachments are preferred. A cover letter is unnecessary.
Please use your title as the e-mail subject. Do not include 'Submission' in the subject.
* You can send any file that Google Docs can handle, including .docx, .odt, .rtf, .txt, and .pdf. Attachments are limited to 10 megabytes. You can test your document in Docs to see how it looks before sending it to us.
* If your e-mail includes an attachment, our robot will discard the rest of the e-mail message.
* When submitting via e-mail body, be sure to include an extra line between paragraphs and dialogue.
* The submission robot will reply to you. It will tell you if something went wrong. After fixing any errors, just resubmit and the robot will do its thing.
* Consider subscribing to our call for submissions mailing list.

### FAQ

##### I sent you my submission, now what?
You should hear back from our robot within 10 minutes. If you don't get a response by end of day, check your spam folder. Failing that, please contact editor@. The robot sometimes misbehaves and we'd like to hear about it.

##### Why do you do blind review?
We're biased and we want to take steps to reduce those biases.

##### When can I expect a response?
Our reading period closes at the end of April and we anticipate being underwater for some time. Please query us if you haven't heard back by July 1.

##### Why don't you use [submission manager]?
Most commercial submission managers are structured to push journals into charging submission fees. We believe that money should always flow from a publisher to an author.

##### Why don't you publish erotica, gore, or inspirational fiction?
We just don't. There are other venues for these works.
