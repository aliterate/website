## About

Aliterate is a production of Genre, Ltd., a federally tax-exempt 501(c)3 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

#### Why Aliterate?
aliterate (n) -- one who can read, but chooses not to

We have an odd sense of humor. Naming things is tough and all the good ones are taken.

#### What the heck is Genre, Ltd?
Genre Limited, get it? Wakka wakka. We got in a second word joke just in our name. This is our legal entity and isn't terribly important.

#### Why are you doing this?
Are you always this curt? We want to encourage genre fiction.
